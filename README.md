# Profile Generator

## Purpose
This was an end of the chapter project for thechapter regarding node in the bootcamp. This chapter was an intro to Node.js as well as the time where we learned some of the latest features in ES6. This project was basically another crash course in inquirer, fs, and a refresher for using call back functions.

## Process
This was actually an assignment we skipped in the bootcap originally so I have nothing to compare it to. I do however take pride in knowing it only took about 30 minutes to complete which helps me realize im right on track and actually proccessing the information this time around. I remember being very confused at this time in the bootcamp especially when it came to using the ES6 features. The app runs using inquirer and gathers information from the user. The information is then plugged into a profile template I made using template literals. As I mentioned this project was pretty easy but it was a nice refresher.
